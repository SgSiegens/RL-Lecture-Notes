# RL-Lecture-Notes
This repository contains unofficial lecture notes for the course Reinforcement Learning [M-INFO-105623] at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). I created these notes to deepen my own understanding of the material. 
Please note that the structure and content reflect my personal learning process and what made the most sense to me. I occasionally used language models to help improve phrasing, as English is not my first language.
